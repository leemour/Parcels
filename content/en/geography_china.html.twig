<h3>Consolidated freight from China</h3>
<p>
    We would like to give you more details about this service. If you have <strong>several shipments</strong> which you are sending nearly at the same time to different recipients it would be much more efficient for you to join them together and the mean of transport is not important in this case. The larger the size of your freight, the lower the delivery rate per product you are shipping. You don't have to pay document processing fees and brokerage rewards for each item â€“ they are charged independently of the cargo volume. We consolidate cargo at the warehouse in <strong>Shenzhen city</strong> (province Guangdong) in the south of China or in Hong Kong.
